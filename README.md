## Heyy 👋😊

<!--
- 🤗 Yes, my name is actually Princess.
- 📚 I'm a student at Strathmore University studying Computer Science.
- 💓 I'm passionate about business and data.
- 💪🏽 Currently working towards becoming a "data angel" - my way of saying that I want to master the art of
 data analysis to make a real-world impact.
- 🎓 I'll be graduating this year from Strathmore Business School. As for Computer Science, I will be
 completing it in 2026.
- 🏋🏽‍♀️ Right now I am working on a data structures-based project that explores role of IT in neurodivergent
 spaces.💭Something that has been on my mind of late is how IT feels intuitively aligned with neurodivergent thinking. 
- 🎀 I'm a big fan of distributed systems which came up as an interest while I was learning Java.
